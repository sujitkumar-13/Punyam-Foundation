(node:78721) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///home/sujit/punyam-foundation/tailwind.config.ts?id=1770288095489 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /home/sujit/punyam-foundation/package.json.
